# A new method to investigate causal genotype combination patterns contribution to complex diseases
Many common human diseases have a strong heritable component.
With the benefit of technological advances, many single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) have been found to be associated with the risk of complex disorders by using
genome wide association studies (GWASs). Disease-associated SNPs are sometimes
shared by healthy controls and cannot clearly distinguish affected individuals from unaffected
ones. The combined effects of multiple independent SNPs contribute to the disease
process, but revealing the relationship between genotype and phenotype based on the combinations
remains a great challenge. By considering the disease prevalence rate, we conducted an exhaustive process
to identify causual genotype combination pattern (CGCPs).By integrating these CGCPs, we would find genes which have a decisive effect on complex disorders.
